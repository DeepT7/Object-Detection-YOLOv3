# Object-Detection-YOLOv3
Learn how to perform object detection on Keras YOLOv3

This is my first project about using YOLO version 3 for object detection. The project uses the tensorflow library and is referenced from the 
following sorces:
keras-yolo3: https://github.com/experiencor/keras-yolo3
tutorial: https://machinelearningmastery.com/

You can download the pre-trained model 'yolo3.weights' at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s_bERr8afh4rke2Rrxj4a50-6nv7tDRL/view?usp=sharing
